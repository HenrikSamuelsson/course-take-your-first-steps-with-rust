# What is Rust

## Introduction

Rust is i programming language for writing systems software.

Rust does not have runtime or garbage collector costing resources, but still offers mechanisms for memory management, preventing a range of bugs that are common in other systems software languages.

Rust aims to balance performance, safety, and implementation expressiveness.

## What is Rust?

Rust is suitable for systems programming due to that it supports both low-level control and high level concepts.

Benefits of Rust are:

- Strict compiler that detects many bugs already at compile time
- Efficient with zero-cost abstractions and a minimal runtime
- Supports bare metal targets directly without additional interpreter layer
- Using Rust is an enjoyable experience according to many developers
