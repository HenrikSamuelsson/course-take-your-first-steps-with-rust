# 8.1 Implement generic types and traits - Introduction

Rust supports *polymorphism* through mechanisms known as *traits* and *generics* which allows for having code that can handle values of different type, even types not existing at the time of writing the code.

Concepts presented in this section are:

- What generic types are
- What traits are and how to implement them
- How to implement an *iterator* to go through a collection

Having an understanding of Rust's types, ownerships, and moves is a prerequisite before taking on this section.
